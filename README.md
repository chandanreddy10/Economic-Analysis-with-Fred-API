# Economic-analysis-with-FRED-API

## In this project I have used FRED API [click here](https://github.com/mortada/fredapi).
## I have tried to answer some questions in series of 4 Jupyter Notebooks using only pandas (for analysis) and matplotlib (for all the visualizations).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Answering the following questions.
## 1. What economic indicators are suggestive of economic growth?
## 2. In what ways do financial crises impact the lives of ordinary people?
## 3. How to define economic welfare?
## 4. To what extent can the government / Central Bank influence the macro-economy?
